# Modelling Customer Satisfaction 
##### The aim of this project is to model customer satisfaction for a logistics and delivery startup. The dataset we will be working with was collected via a customer satisfaction survey, and provided by the startup. Our goal is to create a model that predicts customer satisfaction given responses to the other questions in the survey. Furthermore, our aim is to create an easily interpretable model, so that the startup can learn where it needs to improve its service to improve customer satisfaction.
