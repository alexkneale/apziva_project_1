## Project Structure

# Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information relevant to customer satisfaction in the logistics and delivery context. Key variables may include:

- **Delivery Metrics:** Delivery times, order sizes, delays, etc.
- **Customer Feedback:** Satisfaction ratings, comments, etc.
- **Operational Data:** Route information, shipment details, etc.

*Note: If the data is not included in the repository, please refer to the notebook for instructions on how to obtain or simulate the dataset.*

## Methodology

The project follows these main steps:

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature engineering, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualization of key trends and relationships.
- Statistical summaries to understand data distribution and potential correlations.

### Model Development:
- Implementation of several machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, etc.).
- Model training and cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.

### Model Evaluation:
- Assessment using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Comparative analysis to determine the best performing model.

### Interpretation & Insights:
- Analysis of feature importance.
- Discussion on actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction.

## Results & Insights

The notebook concludes with a detailed discussion of:

- **Key Findings:** What the models reveal about customer satisfaction drivers.
- **Performance Comparison:** How different models performed based on chosen metrics.
- **Business Recommendations:** Strategic insights for operational improvements and enhanced customer service.
